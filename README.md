This package offers a number of algorithms for the calculations of volatilities, correlation matrices and covariance matrices. Covariances can be calculated using the na√Øve method, a multivariate kernel method, a spectral covariance method, preaveraging of returns and finally by exploiting differences in the volatility of different composition series (generated by adding two observed series).

A number of regularisation algorithms are also implemented including eigenvalue cleaning, mixing with the identity matrix and finding the nearest valid correlation matrix.
